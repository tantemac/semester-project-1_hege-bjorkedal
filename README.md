# semester-project-1_hege-bjorkedal

My semester project in my first year as a Front End Developer student at Noroff School of Technology. 
The assignment was to make a website for a fictive science museum in our home town, and the target audience was children and people working with children. 
We had only learned basic HTML and CSS at this time.
